# Improvements in the future
- JUST remove a cleared line normally instead of making the blocks drop with gravity, that's how tetris works bruh
- Instead of going through the hassle of updating each block in a tetromino make the entire tetromino a sprite or something and keep updates on lower bound of block. (already have the code for tetromino lower bound checks)
- Add Hold, Drop, etc.
- Less predictable random generation

# Functionality
- T-spins and L-spins are possible ofc, if you can manage to create an environment to check lmao
- Keeps track of EACH 4 squares in the current tetromino
